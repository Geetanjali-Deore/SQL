# SQL-Data-Analytics-for-startups
## Context
In this project, we decided to go with a dataset of more than 900 startups between 2012-2021 to get information on their valuations, locations, and sectors of expertise. It offers insights into the dynamic world of startups, showcasing their financial standing, geographical presence, and key backers.

## Business case
We took the lenses of a specialized consultancy for startups: Foudning for success.
The main problematic was that startups face challenges to understand the sectors that are more values and where to find the best hubs for their growth.

## Our hyptheses were:
- The country with the highest amount of startups is the United States.
- US startups have the highest valuations.
- The most valued sectors are AI and data.

## Data cleaning
We first cleaned the data using pythonÂ´s pandas. Dropped the columns we did not need, took care of the dupplicated and created the four tables we needed to upload a normalized dataset of 4 tables to SQL in order to proceed to the anaysis.

## Data analysis
We created the ERD in SQL, and uploaded the data.
We played around with querries and gathered relevant insights.

## Insights
- Indeed, the highest amount of startups are found in the United States with over 480 of the +900 located in the US.
- Sweden is the country concentrating the highest valuation in billion US Dollars of startups (14.5 US b) followed by Australia (7.57 US b) and Indonesia(5.6 US b).
- In terms of industry, it is Fintech who wins both in the count of startups dedicated to this type of services together with the valuation cumulation.
